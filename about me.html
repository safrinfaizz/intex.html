<h1>about me </h1>


<p>I am currently a student and a beginner in web development,
     just diving into the world of coding and finding it incredibly interesting. Up until my school years,
      I had no idea that I'd be interested in something like coding or web development. Initially, I pursued a bachelor’s 
      degree in psychology but soon realized that it wasn’t my cup of tea. Now, I’m completing a bachelor’s degree in health informatics,
       where I’ve discovered that my true interest lies in technology.
     This journey has shown me how much I enjoy the technical side of things, 
     especially as I explore front-end development and coding, which I find genuinely fulfilling.</p>
